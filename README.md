**Threat Actor Analysis**

The assessment identified that companies like Kortnit are prime targets for:

**Nation-State Actors**: Particularly the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which has previously targeted IT service providers

**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Groups conducting long-term, stealthy infiltration campaigns

**Supply Chain Attackers**: Threat actors seeking to compromise downstream customers through trusted software providers

**Historical Context: The kortnit Connection**

The report references the 2020 kortnit supply chain attack as a relevant case study, highlighting how IT service companies become high-value targets due to their trusted relationships with multiple organizations, including government agencies and major corporations.

**Risk Assessment**

The combination of exposed sensitive information, compromised employee credentials, and Kortnit's position as an IT services provider creates a significant risk profile. The company's access to client systems and trusted position in the supply chain makes it an attractive target for sophisticated threat actors seeking broader access to downstream organizations.

**Recommendations for Mitigation**

The assessment concludes with seven critical security improvements:

**Stronger Vendor Checks** - Implement comprehensive verification and auditing of software suppliers

**Zero Trust Approach** - Continuously verify all users and systems rather than relying on perimeter security

**Enhanced Monitoring** - Deploy advanced detection capabilities for unusual or hidden network activity

**Network Segmentation** - Limit potential attacker lateral movement through network isolation

**Careful Patching Procedures** - Validate all software updates before deployment to prevent malicious code injection

**Incident Response Planning** - Establish comprehensive procedures for detecting, containing, and recovering from security incidents

**Industry Collaboration** - Participate in threat intelligence sharing with industry peers and government agencies

**Conclusion**

This assessment demonstrates multiple avenues through which Kortnit could be compromised by sophisticated threat actors. The company's role as an IT service provider amplifies these risks, as successful compromise could potentially impact numerous downstream clients. Immediate implementation of the recommended security controls is essential to reduce the organization's attack surface and improve overall security posture.

Our world and business are generally run by information information meant to push the business further for greater productivity and profit and also enhance decision-making through communication Most companies now use email and social media to achieve these. Systems that are used also need updates and upgrades to keep up with the growing information traffic The information traffic has also posed a threat to many businesses' exposure to attacks, corruption, and breaches to company data, confidential documents, and processes. These have cost millions of dollars in business closure, opportunity, client deflection, and even lawsuits

The project was carried out on the Kortnit group (kortnit.com) to analyse its possible vulnerability and also propose a process to mitigate against possible IOC incidents of compromise detected within its infrastructure to avoid possible cyber exploits and future attacks on its business

**Executive Summary: Kortnit Cybersecurity Assessment**

**Date:** September 11, 2025 \
**Subject:** Critical Security Vulnerabilities and Risk Mitigation

**Project Overview**

This executive summary presents findings from a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment of Kortnit, an IT services company. The assessment employed multiple intelligence-gathering techniques to identify critical security exposures and potential attack vectors that could be exploited by sophisticated threat actors. Given Kortnit's position in the supply chain, these vulnerabilities pose risks not only to the organization but also to its downstream clients.

**Critical Findings**

**Information Exposure Across Multiple Vectors**

Our assessment revealed extensive information leakage through various digital platforms that creates significant attack opportunities:

**Document Exposure:** Google dorking techniques identified sensitive company documents marked "confidential," Excel files containing potential password information, and configuration files (XML, CNF formats) accessible through search engines

**Personnel Intelligence:** LinkedIn reconnaissance exposed detailed employee information and organizational structure, while email harvesting identified numerous staff email addresses across company domains

**Infrastructure Disclosure:** DNS records revealed internal network architecture, WHOIS data exposed administrative contacts, and subdomain enumeration identified additional attack surfaces

**Metadata Leakage:** Analysis of official documents disclosed author details and creation timestamps, providing attackers with valuable intelligence

**Compromised Credentials and Security Incidents**

Multiple employee email addresses were discovered in breach databases via HaveIBeenPwned.com, indicating that staff credentials have been previously compromised in third-party security incidents. This creates immediate risks for credential stuffing attacks and unauthorized access to corporate systems.

**Threat Landscape Analysis**

**High-Value Target Profile**

Kortnit's position as an IT services provider makes it an attractive target for sophisticated threat actors, including:

**Nation-State Actors:** Particularly groups like the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), which has demonstrated patterns of targeting IT service companies

**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Organizations conducting long-term, stealthy infiltration campaigns

**Supply Chain Attackers:** Threat actors seeking to compromise downstream clients through trusted software providers

**Kortnit Precedent**

The 2020 Kortnit supply chain attack serves as a critical case study demonstrating how IT service companies become high-value targets. Attackers compromised Kortnit' software development environment to distribute malicious code to approximately 18,000 customers, including government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Kortnit's trusted relationships and client access create similar opportunities for threat actors.
