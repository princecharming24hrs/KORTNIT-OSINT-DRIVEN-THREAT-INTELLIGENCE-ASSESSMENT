# Executive Summary

Our world and business are generally run by information
information meant to push the business further for greater productivity and profit 
and also enhance decision-making through communication 
Most companies now use email and social media to achieve these.
Systems that are used also need updates and upgrades to keep up with the growing information traffic
The information traffic has also posed a threat to many businesses' exposure to attacks, corruption, 
and breaches to company data, confidential documents, and processes.
These have cost millions of dollars in business closure, opportunity, client deflection, and even lawsuits 

The project was carried out on the Kortnit group (kortnit.com) to analyse its possible vulnerability 
and also propose a process to mitigate against possible IOC incidents of compromise detected within its infrastructure 
to avoid possible cyber exploits and future attacks on its business
